# üå± Soila App

**Soila** is a Flutter-based mobile application that leverages NASA datasets to provide real-time analytics and insights for farmers about soil moisture, precipitation, land temperature, and evapotranspiration. The app integrates APIs to deliver actionable data to help farmers optimize water usage and improve crop yields.

## üöÄ Features

- **Soil Moisture Data (SMAP)**: Visualizes soil moisture levels and provides insights for crops like corn and wheat.
- **Rainfall Predictions (IMERG)**: Offers 7-day rainfall forecasts to help plan irrigation and water management.
- **Land Temperature (MODIS)**: Monitors land surface temperature for optimal crop growth.
- **Evapotranspiration (ECOSTRESS)**: Provides data on daily water usage to ensure crops receive the right amount of water.
- **Root Zone Moisture (SMAP)**: Tracks moisture levels in the crop root zone for improved crop health monitoring.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Simplified, easy-to-understand stats like percentages for better decision-making.
- **Google Sign-In**: User authentication using Google accounts.
- **Intuitive Design**: Simple navigation with a clean UI to ensure user-friendliness.
